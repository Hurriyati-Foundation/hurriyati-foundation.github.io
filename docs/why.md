# Why is this important?

In 2025, you, your family, and the people around you are facing a privacy problem. Many are using closed-source apps owned by non-Muslims. By doing this, you are giving these companies control over the security and influence on the Ummah. Even when talking to your family, you may be using apps owned by people who oppose Islamic values, and these companies may use your data to harm Muslims. In some cases, these apps have even been used to endanger lives.

This website helps you find better alternatives for everyday apps. We recommend alternatives in the following order:
1. Muslim-owned open-source apps
