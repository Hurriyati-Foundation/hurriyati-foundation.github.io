# Site Guide

### Here's a quick guide to help you navigate and understand the different features and icons used.

### Left Sidebar
On the left sidebar, you'll find various categories that organize the apps and tools available. The sidebar is designed to help you easily browse through different sections and find exactly what you're looking for.

### Navigating the Site
Find Apps: Go to the "Apps" section on the left sidebar, and look for the emojis next to each app to easily identify its features.
Explore Categories: Use the sidebar categories to browse different types of apps, such as those focused on privacy, productivity, or entertainment.

### Lists
Next to each app in the "Apps" section, you'll find a brief description that explains what the app is and what it offers. This description is separated by a dash (-) to make it easy to read and understand.
Apps are labeled with different emojis and descriptions to provide a clear understanding of their features:
- üïã Kaaba Emoji: This indicates that the app is Muslim-owned. If you see this symbol next to an app, it means the app was created by a Muslim individual or organization.
- ü§ù Handshake Emoji: This shows that the app is Open Source. This means the code that makes the app work is available for anyone to see. You don‚Äôt need to know how to code to use the app, but the code is there for people to check and make sure the app is secure and works as promised. It helps ensure that the app is safe to use and that others can improve it.
- üîí Padlock Emoji: This indicates that the app features Encryption. Apps with this emoji prioritize your privacy and secure your data with encryption methods to keep your information safe.
- ‚≠ê Star Emoji: This emoji means that we actively recommend using this specific app or site.

<small>Note: An app not listed or labeled as Muslim doesn‚Äôt imply it‚Äôs non-Muslim owned; a Muslim may have contributed to any app, whether open or closed source.</small>
